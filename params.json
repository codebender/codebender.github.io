I'm a true Ruby on Rails nerd, I used to be a C# .NET zombie but have since joined and started loving the ruby open source community. More recently I've been working a lot with Rails RESTful APIs and AngularJS front-ends. I enjoy developing with the TDD methodology. As a lead engineer, I am passionate in improving those around me. I attend conferences, go to meet-ups, read blogs, and listen to podcasts, always trying to bring interesting and new ideas to my team. I am now exploring more programming languages for cases when certain technologies can help scale an application. I most interested in Node.js, Elixir, and Go. I have also dabbled in R and started learning the value of data science. \r\n\r\nOpen Source R'Angular project, Ruby on Rails + AngularJS:\r\n* [5280Code](https://github.com/codebender/5280code)\r\n  * Integrates with Fitbit API for health data\r\n  * Integrates with Bitstamp and Pusher web sockets for real-time Bitcoin prices\r\n\r\nOpen Source Ruby on Rails + R Project:\r\n* [Rails Pirate](https://github.com/codebender/rails_pirate)\r\n\r\nOpen Source R - Kaggle.com Repositories:\r\n* [kaggle-titanic-r](https://github.com/codebender/kaggle-titanic-r)\r\n* [kaggle-digit-recognizer](https://github.com/codebender/kaggle-digit-recognizer)\r\n* [kaggle-bike-sharing](https://github.com/codebender/kaggle-bike-sharing)\r\n\r\nPersonal Sandbox Websites:\r\n* [5280Code.com](http://5280code.com)\r\n* [BentSolutions.com](http://bentsolutions.com)\r\n","google":"UA-21922647-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
